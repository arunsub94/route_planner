# route_planner
Route Planner that determines the shortest path between two locations using the A* search algorithm. Final submission for the Udacity Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Nanodegree. 

The Route Planner is the basis of satellite navigation applications such as Google Maps that helps in mapping out a route from point A to point B geographically. 
The A* algorithm was employed to achieve the objective of returning the shortest path between two nodes (cities, towns, locations, etc.) by minimizing the total cost of each path which 
is computed as the sum of the path cost (cost of a path from start) and a heuristic cost (which is a measure of the distance of the node from the goal).

The .ipynb file also has the code to help visualize the output of the route planner on a graph representation. The code for this was provided by Udacity. The code under student.py is
entirely my work. Please do not replicate or reproduce the code without prior consent.
